# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


- **Question 1**: Add at least 3 Project features

   - **Feature 1**: Describe the first feature of your project.
     - Explain what it does and why it's important.
     - You can use bullet points or paragraphs for details.

   - **Feature 2**: Describe the second feature of your project.
     - Provide information on how to use it or how it enhances the project.

   - **Feature 3**: Describe the third feature of your project.
     - Discuss its functionality and any benefits it brings.

- **Question 2**: Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

   - In this project, we haven't implemented a complex state management solution as it's focused on React + Vite integration.
   - You can choose your preferred state management library or pattern based on your project's requirements and complexity.
